A simple tutorial repo

Hey everyone!

I'm a 20 year old aspiring web developer from Warrenton, Missouri. I've using Javascript and React to build my own little projects for nearly a year now, and am now looking into backend development to build my own backend for my calorie counter app. I'm very interested in learning React Native one of these days as well. When I'm not coding, you'll find me out on a run, hitting the gym, reading about stoic philosophy, or listening to some oldies.
